-- TTM from a stated year, and a net debt that can be absent. Everything else in
-- gold.refresh_derived_financials is 014's.
--
-- A year's total without its quarters. TTM was only ever four contiguous quarters, so a fiscal year
-- whose quarters are incomplete had no annual figure even with the 10-K's own total in silver: NVIDIA's
-- FY2023 capex (1,833; its 10-Qs that year tag neither quarters nor six months in us-gaap), Amazon's
-- FY2017 capex (11,955; no fact ends 2017-06-30). An annual-length fact (350-380 days) now fills a TTM
-- row where the sums left none. inputs.quarters has that one fact, so anything reading it still works.
--
-- Net debt: long_term_debt + long_term_debt_current - cash - short_term_investments, with the
-- investments term decided per date:
--   a value at that date: subtracted, unless it can't be on top of cash. Cash + investments + receivables
--     + inventory larger than current assets means the note's "short-term investments" are a part of
--     cash (Target's 10-K: 4,611 inside its 5,488), and subtracting both counts them twice.
--   none at that date, and a recent, material series before it: unknown, so net debt is absent rather
--     than treating it as zero. Recent: within 730 days. Material: at least 1% of total assets and at
--     least 10% of debt less cash, so it could change what the figure says. Unless current assets
--     have no room for it: current assets less cash, receivables and inventory smaller than the last
--     value means the balance sheet that would hold it doesn't (Neumora, VF), and that's the filing
--     supporting zero; so is a filing that tags zero, which arrives as a value at that date.
--   none, and no such series: zero, as before. Most companies hold none.
-- A series that ended over two years ago isn't evidence either way: it counts as zero, as today. If it
-- really moved to a tag not mapped here (Visa's investment securities), net debt stays too high. On
-- hermes (2026-11-06, existing tags) 377 of 2,835 latest net debts sit after a series that ended over
-- two years before; 16 would change sign if the old amount were still held, among them Nike (fixed by
-- 038's tag), IDEXX and SI-BONE. Without the two-year limit 52 more would be absent, mostly companies
-- that really sold their investments (Dell, TJX).
--
-- Debt that can't be all of it: a year's interest more than twice the debt it would be paid on, and the
-- debt wasn't simply paid down during the year (over twice as much a year earlier). Ford's only mapped debt
-- tags are a $291M sliver (its consolidated debt is by segment), which gave a net debt of -$49.67B and
-- 0.01x beside $5.05B of interest: both absent. Same for Sun Communities and OPKO. Zero debt with interest
-- is a company that repaid it (Sonos, Teradata, Vertex) and stays.
--
-- Golden: gold.derived_metrics' definition changes wording, and tests/golden's formula still holds
-- for all five companies: none hits the unknown rule, none has investments inside cash.
--
-- Locks on hermes: CREATE OR REPLACE and two UPDATEs on gold.derived_metrics (a 13-row table, row locks).
-- Gold changes on `facts-fetcher --rebuild`.
