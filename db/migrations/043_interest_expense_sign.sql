-- Interest expense is a cost: gold reads it without the filing's sign (M7).
--
-- On hermes (2026-11-08, gold built by 031): 2,951 negative interest_expense quarters at 986 companies,
-- 1,713 reported (503 companies) and 1,238 derived (762). Silver holds 23,396 negative facts under the four
-- interest expense tags (21,538 of 737,252 InterestExpense facts) at about 1,900 CIKs. Read one by one they
-- are the filing's presentation sign, not a negative cost:
--   - a filer's sign flips between filings: UDR tags its first quarters -30,981K and -32,884K among +31,000K
--     quarters; NetApp FY2024 Q1-Q2 -16M and -15M beside +17M; ManpowerGroup's 2025 and 2026 10-Ks restate
--     2023's year as -79.7M where the 2024 10-K said +79.7M.
--   - a year-to-date difference across a flip is wrong both ways: Disney's FY2025 10-K tags the year
--     -1,812M against nine months of +1,396M in its 10-Qs, so Q4 came out -3,208M (with the sign, 416M);
--     ManpowerGroup's 2023 Q4 came out -139.4M (20.0M).
--   - a whole series negative: Hasbro tags every quarter about -22.5M.
-- So gold.usable_facts reads interest expense as abs(value) under every tag, before anything is summed,
-- chosen or differenced; silver keeps the filing's figure (FR6). A filer that tags net interest income
-- under an expense tag would read as an expense: none was found in the sample, and the statements already
-- say so for a bank whose revenue is net of interest (B6). The golden figures store the expense as positive
-- (NVIDIA's note: "printed as a negative in other income; gold stores the expense as positive"), and no
-- golden fixture has a negative interest fact, so they don't change.
--
-- A derived quarter that still comes out negative is one input of another scope (Sphere's FY2022: a 10-KT
-- filed in 2025 restates the year to 0 after a spin-off, against nine months of 23.2M in older 10-Qs): left
-- out, like 029's other costs. interest_expense joins that list in gold.refresh_quarterly_financials.
--
-- Bodies are 039's, copied; the two edits are marked "043". A later rewrite keeps both (and everything 039
-- keeps). Locks on hermes: two CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION, nothing on any table. Gold changes on the
-- financials-rebuild job (docs: deploy/helm/tributary README); expected figures in its runbook. Backout:
-- db/backout/interest_expense_043.sql.
